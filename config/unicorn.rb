  # The following is only recommended for memory/DB-constrained
  # installations.  It is not needed if your system can house
  # twice as many worker_processes as you have configured.
  #
  # # This allows a new master process to incrementally
  # # phase out the old master process with SIGTTOU to avoid a
  # # thundering herd (especially in the "preload_app false" case)
  # # when doing a transparent upgrade.  The last worker spawned
  # # will then kill off the old master process with a SIGQUIT.

  # from being lost when the receiving process is busy.
